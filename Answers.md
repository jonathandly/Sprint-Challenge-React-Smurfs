1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Server-side routing will only request the data that's needed. Search engines are optimized for webpages that come from the server. Every request results in a full-page refresh.

Client-side routing between views is usually faster. The whole website needs to be loaded on the first request. Requires more code or a library to enable client-side routing. The webpage is less optimized for search engines to crawl.
